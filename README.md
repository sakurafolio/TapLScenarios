# TapLScenarios
These are scenarios I have recreated from [TapL](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9tXyGZiEft9J4ZiI8dHb3Q) videos. Since
this is a portfolio project, I do not recommend using these in an actual UHC server since there are no commands to
enable and disable scenarios at will. However, feel free to take what I have written and use it in your server. I don't
mind.

This idea comes from [Portvolio](https://github.com/portvolio). Violet got me (unintentionally) interested in remaking
these and I really had a bad day when I started doing this. I just needed something to distract myself. This is fun to
me.
